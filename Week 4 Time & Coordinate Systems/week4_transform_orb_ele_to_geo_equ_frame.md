1. Find out how we get back to IJK from PQW
    - If you want to go from IJK to PQW, use Q (R_313(Omega, i, omega))
        - You should be able to find r_IJK using some other way or it might be given to you
    - If you want to go from PQW to IJK, use Q_T (R_313(-omega, -i, -Omega))
2. Find out how to get the cartesian coordinate value v
    - It is now in the program but has been commented out
