function week9_interplanetary_transfer()
    
    % REGION 1: SUN-CENTRED TRANSFER
        % I think it's just a Hohmann's transfer, could be wrong tho

    % REGION 2: EARTH DEPARTURE
        % 1. Start in circular orbot
        % 2. Fire the rocket to get a velocity change (boost)
        % 3. Go into hyperbolic trajectory
        % 4. At SOI, spacecraft has needed "extra" or "excess" velocity to enter heliocentric elliptical transfer orbit (but no burn)
        % 5. Hyperbolic trajectory!
        % 6. Hyperbolic excess speed: the extra velocity needed to go into the transfer orbit at Earth's SOI

    % REGION 3: ARRIVAL AT TARGET PLANET
